# Leetcode - 70. Climbing Stairs (E)

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 45`

```java
// Java 0ms (Beats 100%), Time O(N), Space O(N)
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

dp[i] = can use how many ways to climb to step i
動態轉移方程 : dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
