# Leetcode - 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique (M-)

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)

A string `s` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same **frequency**.

Given a string `s`, return_ the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make _`s`_ **good**._

The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `"aab"`, the **frequency** of `'a'` is `2`, while the **frequency** of `'b'` is `1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: `s` is already good.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s`Â contains only lowercase English letters.
