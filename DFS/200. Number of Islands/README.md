# Leetcode - 200. Number of Islands (M)

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```
**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
-   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

```java
// Java DFS
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int counts = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != '0') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    counts++;
                }
            }
        }
        return counts;
    }

    public void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m ||  j >= n || grid[i][j] == '0')
            return;
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }

}
```

Use DFS to find island.
When find island, mark `grid[i][j] = '0'` to represent it has been visited.
